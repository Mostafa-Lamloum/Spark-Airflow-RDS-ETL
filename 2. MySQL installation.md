# Installation Steps for MySQL and MySQL Workbench on Ubuntu 22.04

This repository contains a project that requires MySQL and MySQL Workbench to be installed on Ubuntu 22.04 using the Snap command. 
Here are the steps to follow to install MySQL and MySQL Workbench:
Prerequisites

**Before you can install MySQL and MySQL Workbench, you need to have the following:**

   * Ubuntu 22.04 installed on your computer
   * A user account with sudo privileges
   * Internet connectivity

## 1. Installing MySQL

Open a terminal window by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T` or by clicking on the Terminal icon in the launcher.

  1. Run the following command to update the package repository:

    sudo apt update

  2. Run the following command to install MySQL using the apt command:

    sudo apt install mysql-server

  3. Ensure that the server is running using the systemctl start command:

    sudo systemctl start mysql.service
      
## 2. Configuring MySQL 
   Because the `mysql_secure_installation` script performs a number of other actions that are useful for keeping your MySQL installation secure, 
   it’s still recommended that you run it before you begin using MySQL to manage your data.
   To avoid entering this recursive loop, though, you’ll need to first adjust how your root MySQL user authenticates.
   
   1.  Open up the MySQL prompt:
        
    sudo mysql
   
  2. Then run the following ALTER USER command to change the root user’s authentication method to one that uses a password:
          
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
      
  3. Exit the MySQL prompt:
      
    exit
      
  4. Run the security script with `sudo`:
      
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
      
During the MySQL installation process, you will be presented with a series of prompts that allow you to adjust the security options. 
One of the prompts will give you the option to configure the Validate Password Plugin. Enabling this feature will help ensure that the passwords 
used for new MySQL users meet certain strength requirements before they are approved.*
    
   Regardless of whether you choose to set up the Validate Password Plugin, the next prompt will be to set a password for the MySQL root user. 
   Enter and then confirm a secure password of your choice:
      
    Output
    Please set the password for root here.
    
    New password:

    Re-enter new password:
        
 Choose your own password and confirm
  
## 3. Installing MySQL Workbench

   1. Run the following command to install MySQL Workbench using the Snap command:

    sudo snap install mysql-workbench-community

   2. Verify that MySQL and MySQL Workbench have been installed by running the following command:

    mysql --version && mysql-workbench --version

   3. You should see output similar to the following:

    mysql  Ver 8.0.27-0ubuntu0.22.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))
    MySQL Workbench Community (GPL) 8.0.27 CE build 1965317 (64 bits)

After successfully installing MySQLWorkbench as a Snap package, you may want to store your database password(s) using the Gnome Passwords & Keys facility.      However, Snap packages are sandboxed and are not permitted to access this service by default. When you try to store the password using the "Store in keychain" option, MySQLWorkbench will be prevented by AppArmor.

  4. To resolve this issue, you need to run a command that will allow the package to access the service. The command is:

    sudo snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service :password-manager-service

     
  You're all set! You can now use MySQL and MySQL Workbench on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.

## Troubleshooting

   * Make sure that your Ubuntu 22.04 system meets the minimum requirements for running MySQL and MySQL Workbench.
   * If you are still having issues, please refer to the MySQL and MySQL Workbench documentation or contact their support team for assistance.
