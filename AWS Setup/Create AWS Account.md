# Creating an AWS Account

Creating an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account is a simple process that involves providing some basic information and verifying your identity.
In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to create an AWS account.

**Prerequisites**

To create an AWS account, you need the following:

   * A valid email address
   * A valid credit card (for billing purposes)

## Steps:

1. Go to the [AWS Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click the "Create an AWS Account" button.

On this page, we enter our email address and AWS account name. The account name is not that important. You can change it after logging into the account.

2. Confirm your Email address using the verification code:

4. Here we need to provide real data. This is because they will be needed to verify the card and phone number:

Here there will also be a need to confirm the withdrawal of 1 dollar from the account. This money will be reclaimed back after verification from AWS website.

6. Confirm our phone number. To do this, we need to select the type of verification:

***Congratulations*** 
The account has been created, but we still have to wait a while for it to be activated. We will receive information about this by email.

After logging in, we will see the main AWS console panel.
