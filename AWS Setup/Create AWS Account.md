# Creating an AWS Account

Creating an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account is a simple process that involves providing some basic information and verifying your identity.
In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to create an AWS account.

**Prerequisites**

To create an AWS account, you need the following:

   * A valid email address
   * A valid credit card (for billing purposes)

## Steps:

1. Go to the [AWS Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click the "Create an AWS Account" button.

On this page, we enter our email address and AWS account name. The account name is not that important. You can change it after logging into the account.
